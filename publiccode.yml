      ## What is eduID?


      eduID is a federated identity - a user identity that can be used in
      several different organisations that have agreed on how identities will be
      managed. The basic idea is that a given user, who is authenticated with an
      organisation, is automatically authenticated with other organisations in
      the federation.


      Federated identities are one of the cornerstones of trust between
      organisations. Trust is based on all the organisations relying on all the
      others to carry out their authentication - identification and verification
      - properly and in a controlled and reliable IT environment.


      ## Why have eduID?


      From the user's perspective, in the long-term eduID means fewer accounts
      to keep track of. For many organisations, identity management is a complex
      issue and it is necessary to work with confirmed users.


      There are many services that require identification of users. This is
      often done by the user entering an email address to which the service
      provider sends a password. Such a user is normally called unconfirmed,
      because the service provider does not really know who the user with that
      email address is - and for many services this is at a sufficient level.
      Through the use of eduID, identification of users is elevated to that of
      confirmed users. You can read more about these requirements in the
      Assurance levels help section.

      When will I use eduID?


      Depending on where you work or study you might only use your eduID account
      a few times, or you might use it every day. Some schools, institutions and
      services use eduID as their identity provider, this means you will use
      your eduID to gain access to their IT-systems. Or you may mainly use your
      eduID account to create and access other accounts, such as your student
      account or e.g. universityadmissions.se.
